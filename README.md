# JS handbook

## Rationale
This is an evolving guide and reference point for the JavaScript developer. My hope here is to grow and maintain an archive of documentation and examples in the hope that I can memorise more of the language features. By reading articles and creating notes my hope is that I will better memorise the finer details of how JavaScript works. I hope also this will be a useful resource for others too.
